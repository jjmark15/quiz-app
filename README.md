## Project Aims

- teach me a Rust web framework (warp)
- provide a playground for trying to implement good practices for structure, dependency inversion, testing and TDD
- be small enough so that I can refactor without too much effort when my understanding of best practices improves

## Functional Targets

- be a quiz app
    - backend rest api that can store and fetch sets of quiz questions
    - small mobile-first front end web app for users to play the quiz
